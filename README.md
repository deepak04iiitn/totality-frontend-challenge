Redux Integration: Manages global state, including the current theme (light/dark), user authentication, and cart state.


4. Node.js (Runtime Environment)
What: JavaScript runtime that executes server-side code.
How: Handles all the backend operations, such as database interactions and request handling.
Where:
Server-side Logic: Runs the Express.js application, processes API requests, and performs actions like fetching property listings and handling booking requests.


5. Redux & Redux Toolkit (State Management)
What: Manages the application state across components.

Session Persistence: Uses redux-persist to ensure that the user's cart and session are maintained across page reloads.


6. Tailwind CSS (Styling)
What: Utility-first CSS framework for styling the UI.
How: Provides pre-built utility classes to style components quickly.
Where:
UI Components: Used across the website for consistent, responsive design. For example, on the home page, search results, property cards, cart items, and checkout pages.
Mobile Responsiveness: Ensures the website looks good on both desktop and mobile screens.


7. React Router (Routing)
What: Library for handling navigation and routing in React apps.
How: Enables page navigation without reloading the entire page (client-side routing).

Protected Routes: Uses PrivateRoute to guard certain routes (e.g., the profile, cart, checkout) that require user authentication.


8. Firebase (Google OAuth Authentication)
What: Provides secure authentication services using Google sign-in.
How: Integrates with Firebase to manage user login and sign-up via Google accounts.
Where:
